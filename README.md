# ScrollPickerDemo
Demo project to showcase and test my android [ScrollPicker](https://github.com/tomeeeS/ScrollPicker) custom view.

## Dependencies

### the demo part (app module)
* written in kotlin 
* Minsdk is 16.  

### [ScrollPicker](https://github.com/tomeeeS/ScrollPicker) (scroll_picker library module, which will be your only dependency from here if you include it in your project)
* You don't need Java 8, nor kotlin compiler for this as it was written in Java 7.  
* Minsdk is 11.  
* Uses com.android.support:appcompat-v7:28.0.0-alpha1 version of the v7 support lib. If you use another support lib version in your app you might have a problem - which can be solved by either using this exact version mentioned OR with gradle dependency constraints as far as I know.
